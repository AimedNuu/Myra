# Myra

Myra is UI Library for the [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/).  
It has following functionality:
* **Texture Atlases.** That could be loaded at the run-time from LibGDX .atlas format.
* **Bitmap Fonts.** Myra has it's own text renderer that allows text wrapping and coloring. Fonts could be loaded at the run-time from AngelCode's BMFont ASCII .fnt format. [Cyotek.Drawing.Bitmap](https://github.com/cyotek/Cyotek.Drawing.BitmapFont) library is used for that.
* **UI Widgets.** Button, CheckBox, ComboBox, Grid, Image, Menu, ScrollPane, SplitPane(with arbitrary number of splitters), TextBlock, TextField, Tree and Window.
* **UI Skinning.** The awesome default skin had been borrowed from the [VisUI](https://github.com/kotcrab/vis-editor/wiki/VisUI) project. The default skin could be replaced with a custom skin loaded from the JSON.
* **Standalone UI Editor.** It uses Myra itself as UI. Though it's not ready yet and therefore not included in the installation package.

The documentation is rather poor yet: [https://github.com/rds1983/Myra/wiki](https://github.com/rds1983/Myra/wiki).
